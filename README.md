Paired Project, Turing FEE Course Mod 2

### Description
This a recipe tracking / meal prepping application that allows the user to view their pantry items, favorite recipes, recipes they want to cook and shows them what ingredients they need to buy for each recipe. Similar applications would be [All Recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) or [New York Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/), but this application tops them both.

### Timeline
As a team we first began working with logic in each class file. This took us about 4 days to build and refactor. The rest of the time was spent working with the DOM in script.js.

### Usage
Each User will have a pantry, a list of their favorite recipes and a list of recipes they wish to cook. Users are able to search through the 50 recipes we have on the application and save recipes to the whichever one of their lists they choose.

If a User is unable to cook a recipe based on their pantry, they will be displayed a list of missing ingredients. If they are able to make the recipe they are presented with a button "I cooked this!" that will then take the ingredients used on the recipe out of the users pantry.


### Final Outcome
When going the the application the user will be greeted with this home page and can display recipes.

The User can then search recipes. The User can search with a recipe name, ingredient or tag. Any recipe the user is able to cook with their current pantry ingredients will be highlighted with a green border. The search bar is dynamic and tries to assist the user with what it thinks they would like displayed. For example, if the user clicks the 'Search All Recipes' button without inputting a search parameter first, all recipes on the site are displayed. If they input a search parameter, only the results matching that parameter are displayed from all recipes or the users favorites, depending on which search button was clicked.

The User can favorite (heart icon) or add the recipe to cook (chef icon) on any recipe. The User can then view their favorites or their recipes to cook using the corresponding buttons. The User can also search through their favorite recipes based off recipe name, ingredient or tag.
