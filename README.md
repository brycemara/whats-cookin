## Eat Me! (Whats Cookin?!)
[Bryce Jarrett](https://github.com/brycemara) and [Shawn Truesdale](https://github.com/Shawntru)

Paired Project Mod 2

### Description
This a recipe tracking / meal prepping application that allows the user to view their pantry items, favorite recipes, recipes they want to cook and shows them what ingredients they need to buy for each recipe. Similar applications would be [All Recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) or [New York Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/), but this application tops both those.

### Timeline
As a team we first began working with logic in each class file. This took us about 4 days to build and refactor. The rest of the time was spent working with the DOM in script.js.

### Usage
Each User will have a pantry, a list of their favorite recipes and a list of recipes they wish to cook. Users are able to search through the 50 recipes we have on the application and add recipes to the whichever one of their lists they choose.

If a User is unable to cook a recipe based on their pantry they will be displayed a list of missing ingredients. If they are able to make the recipe they are presented a button "I cooked this!" that will then take the ingredients used on the recipe out of the Users pantry.


### Final Outcome
When going the the application the user will be greeted with this home page and can display recipes.

The User can then search recipes. The User can search with a recipe name, ingredient or tag.

The User can favorite (heart icon) or add the recipe to cook (chef icon) on any recipe. The User can then view their favorites or their recipes to cook using the corresponding buttons. The User can also search through their favorite recipes based off recipe name, ingredient or tag.
